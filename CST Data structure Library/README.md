## Overview

The **Customized Standard Template Data Structure Library** is a collection of linear and non-linear data structures implemented in C++ using templates. This library is designed to provide flexible, type-independent data structures that can be easily integrated into various C++ projects. The use of templates allows for the creation of data structures that can handle any data type, offering versatility and efficiency.

## Contents

This library includes the following data structures:

1. **Class SingyLL**: Implementation of a Singly Linked List.
2. **Class DoublyLL**: Implementation of a Doubly Linked List.
3. **Class SinglyCircular**: Implementation of a Singly Circular Linked List.
4. **Class DoublyCircular**: Implementation of a Doubly Circular Linked List.
5. **Class Stack**: Implementation of a Stack using linked list structure.
6. **Class Queue**: Implementation of a Queue using linked list structure.
7. **Class BinarySearchTree**: Implementation of a Binary Search Tree.

## Features

- **Template-Based Design**: All data structures are implemented using C++ templates, allowing them to be type-independent and versatile.
- **Memory Efficient**: The library uses linked list structures for its implementations, making it memory efficient and suitable for dynamic data management.
- **Modular Classes**: Each data structure is encapsulated within its own class, making the library easy to use and extend.
- **Comprehensive Functionality**: The classes provide a wide range of operations, such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching, tailored to the specific needs of each data structure.

## Advantages

- **Flexibility**: The use of templates means that the data structures can handle any data type, from basic types like integers and floats to complex user-defined types.
- **Reusability**: The modular design of the classes allows for easy reuse of code across different projects.
- **Performance**: The library is designed to be efficient, with optimized algorithms for common operations on data structures.
- **Learning Resource**: This library serves as an educational tool for understanding and implementing advanced data structures in C++.

## Installation

To use the Customized Standard Template Data Structure Library, simply include the `Cstdsl.cpp` file in your C++ project and instantiate the desired data structures with your chosen data type.

```cpp
#include "Cstdsl.cpp"

// Example usage
SinglyLL<int> l1;
    l1.InsertFirst(11);
    l1.InsertLast(21);
    l1.InsertLast(51);
    l1.InsertLast(111);
    l1.InsertLast(110);
    l1.Display();

SingyLL<int> intList;
Stack<float> floatStack;
BinarySearchTree<string> stringTree;
```
